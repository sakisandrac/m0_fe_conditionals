# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- I feel pretty confident in my understanding of comparison operators. Although even though I know that you have to use === when comparing exact values, I still sometimes forget and try and use =. I think it will just come with practice to get used to writing the ===.

2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- I feel very confident in my understanding of logical operators. It seems pretty straightforward to me.

3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- I feel confident with if statements, but the least confident in these in comparison to the other topics. I had to google a lot but in the end I feel confident with the code I've written so I am very proud of myself.

4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- To be honest I didn't keep track of time when I was doing this lesson. I will be sure to pay more attention in the future, but I estimate it was around 2 hours. I think that for how much code there was the amount of time that I took was good and I didn't spend too long on it.

5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I want to practice just writing more code because sometimes I feel like I will understand the concepts or the logic of a problem easily when I'm just reading or taking notes, but then when it comes time to just start writing I have a hard time. Maybe I can block out a small chunk of time each day where I independently practice writing out the concepts I've learned through code.

6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- The biggest question I have is just where this is all going. Its hard to see how using a comparison operator will equal complicated code or how any of this actually related to the things you see on a webpage. I will most likely do research on my own to understand where this all goes next.
